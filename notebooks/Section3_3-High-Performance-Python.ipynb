    "\n",
    "[`numexpr`](http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) allows array expressions to be evaluated far faster that what can be achieved in Python using Numpy arrays. `numexpr` parses a string expression and optimizes and compiles the code on the fly, using a virtual machine that includes a [Just-in-time (JIT) compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation). In addition, `numexpr` offers direct support for parallel multi-threaded computations, since Python's global interpreter lock is bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread runs in the interpreter at once. This simplifies many of the low-level activities, such as memory management, and allows for co-operative multi-tasking. But, since the currently-running thread holds onto the interpreter, it makes multi-core parallelization difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part the reason Python can be slow for array calculations is that it creates temporary arrays to store intermediate results from array element calculations, which wastes memory and cache. `numexpr` handles such calculations in manageable chunks, which accellerates computation.\n",
